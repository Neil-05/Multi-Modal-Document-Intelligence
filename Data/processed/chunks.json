    "content": "PR25/034 IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2024 Article IV Consultation with Qatar FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Washington, DC – February 11, 2025: On January 27, 2025, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Qatar. Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued, with signs of strengthening activities more recently. Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in 2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, and strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average, boosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing reforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will likely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term. With lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in 2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses moderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively, both the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share of GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. Banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to 20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. Since the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities, banks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average maturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio remained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is relatively high at above 80 percent.",

Domestic downside risk stems mainly from further weaknesses in the real estate sector, although strong tourism and policy measures introduced in 2023 could mitigate the risk. Over the medium and long term, supply in the global natural gas market is expected to expand significantly, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. On the upside, sustained high hydrocarbon prices and accelerated NDS3 reforms would strengthen the outlook. However, if ambitious NDS3 initiatives lead to resource misallocation, both the public finance and growth prospect would be affected. Executive Board Assessment2 Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Qatar’s continued resilience to external shocks and its favorable medium-term outlook, driven by significant increases in LNG production and the reforms under the Third National Development Strategy. Directors agreed that maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and accelerating reform efforts would further solidify macroeconomic stability and resilience to shocks while boosting prosperity. Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence and called for accelerating fiscal reforms. They recommended adopting a medium-term fiscal anchor to help ensure intergenerational equity, and reiterated the need to accelerate revenue diversification, particularly by introducing the value-added tax. Directors highlighted the importance of improving spending efficiency and composition, particularly by enhancing public investment management. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions and adopt a full-fledged medium-term fiscal framework with enhanced fiscal risk management. Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic financial markets, while encouraging them to consider undertaking a Financial Sector Assessment Program update. They welcomed the newly introduced risk-based supervision",

Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform momentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Outlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium- term outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and reform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far been resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall. Qatar’s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks. Fiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The positive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to introduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending efficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient spending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term fiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will enhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency and risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy. Monetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country well. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the recent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and formalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding through market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks’ exposure to short-term",

Qatar has started the implementation of the much anticipated Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to chart a new course for economic transformation (Text Figure 1). Driven by significant public infrastructure investment over the last decade, Qatar’s non- hydrocarbon economy has grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output. Diversification in fiscal revenue and exports, however, has progressed more slowly. The trend decline in total factor productivity has also been a drag to economic growth. Acknowledging these challenges, NDS3 (launched in January 2024) calls for a decisive transition from the costly state-driven growth model to a private sector-led one, with the state becoming an enabler. NDS3 is reform-focused, aiming to build a more sustainable and knowledge-based economy, with ambitious targets set and “diversification clusters” identified to build comparative advantages (Annex I). Reform momentum has strengthened significantly since the launch of NDS3. Text Figure 1. Qatar’s Diversification Progress and Challenges Qatar has made limited progress in economic diversification. While Qatar’s infrastructure quality has improved significantly… …its productivity growth has been subdued.

Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of a gradual rebound more recently (Figure 1 and Text Figure 2).

Tourism rose significantly since the World Cup, with visitor arrivals rising 60 percent from 2022 to 2023. Real GDP growth strengthened gradually to an average of 1.4 percent (year on year) in the first three quarters of 2024, supported by non-hydrocarbon growth of 2.9 percent. The peak tourist arrivals during the 2024 soccer Asian Cup (January–February) exceeded those during the World Cup. The population continued to rise and employment reached a record high.

Monetary policy easing will likely accelerate domestic credit growth and bolster broader economic activities. Medium- term growth is expected to accelerate (to an average of around 4¾ percent) on the back of massive North Field LNG production expansion (a cumulative increase of around 85 percent by 2030), and initial NDS3 reform gains. Headline inflation will likely ease to 1 percent in 2024, before converging to 2 percent over the medium term as monetary policy eases and growth strengthens. 9. The external and fiscal surpluses will likely remain, albeit declining as a share of GDP. Qatar’s LNG production expansion is set to generate significant hydrocarbon revenues and maintain the twin surpluses, assuming continued fiscal discipline. The surpluses (in percent of GDP), however, are projected to moderate over the medium term as hydrocarbon prices are expected to soften. Central government debt is set to gradually decline to around 36 percent of GDP by 2029. Qatar is assessed to have a low overall risk of sovereign stress (Annex IV). 10.      Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced (Annex V). Main external downside risks include a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in global financial conditions and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical tensions. The regional conflict has had limited impact on Qatar, but adds further to the downside risks with potential impact through lower tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon prices.

The authorities plan to resume gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024. Despite a moderate fiscal loosening in 2023 amid slower growth, the NHPB is estimated to remain consistent with the level suggested by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), a benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity (Text Figure 9). 4 The 2024 budget envisages spending cuts worth 2 ppts of GDP from the 2023 outturn, mostly in capital expenditure, while the fiscal outturn up to the third quarter of 2024 suggests that the overall expenditure cuts could be milder than budgeted, closer to 1½ ppts pf GDP. Nonetheless, the fiscal stance is still likely to tighten, with the NHPB projected to improve by around ¾ ppt of non- hydrocarbon GDP. The 2025 budget envisages broadly prudent spending plans amid the growth rebound. The medium- term budget has been updated to reflect NDS3 spending needs, where continued gradual consolidation is expected. 14.      Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence and recommended adopting a fiscal anchor to support the strategy. The PIH-based benchmark can serve as a medium-term fiscal anchor to ensure intergenerational equity. Higher-than-expected hydrocarbon revenues should be saved to strengthen fiscal buffers. During economic downturns, some fiscal space could be deployed to provide targeted support, while a credible plan should be in place to guide the NHPB to return to the PIH-based fiscal anchor (with a view to eventually introducing a fiscal rule). 5 The assessment of fiscal stance would be more accurate if expenditures by government related entities (GREs) are also accounted for. The PIH-based fiscal anchor should be updated periodically as the global energy transition unfolds to ensure realistic long-term oil price assumptions.",

To strengthen resilience and reduce Qatar’s potential tax revenue gap, non- hydrocarbon revenue diversification should accelerate, taking advantage of Qatar’s favorable medium-term outlook (Text Figure 10).6 Priorities include to: • Introduce the value-added tax (VAT). The tax authority has readied the infrastructure for VAT introduction and staff reiterated that the authorities accelerate the introduction of a broad-based VAT with a starting rate in line with the GCC treaty. The VAT implementation would not only bring in additional revenue (up to 1½ percent of GDP with a VAT rate of 5 percent), but also help gather comprehensive information, facilitating other tax introduction and administration. The initial growth and inflation impact of VAT introduction is estimated to be transitory and small. 7 The negative growth impact could be further mitigated by using the VAT revenue productively. Allowing businesses sufficient time to prepare (e.g., 12 months) is also crucial for a smooth rollout. • Broaden the corporate income tax (CIT). Along with other GCC countries, Qatar is committed to adopt the global minimum CIT on multinationals (foreign companies are already subject to 10 percent of CIT in Qatar). It is encouraging that Qatar is aiming to start the implementation from the beginning of 2025, consistent with the global timetable. The implementation should proceed in line with global trends to avoid revenue losses and minimize the compliance burden on businesses.

Gradually aligning Qatar’s domestic energy prices with its corresponding export prices could increase revenue, generate savings, and support Qatar’s climate goals. Thanks to previous subsidy reforms, domestic energy price differentials from international ones are lower in Qatar than in its regional and emerging market (EM) peers (Text Figure 11). To further reduce the price differentials, the caps on diesel and gasoline prices should be lifted and remaining electricity subsidies gradually phased out. The natural gas price differential (IEA, 2022) partially reflects the supply-demand dynamics in domestic and international markets. 8 The first step is to improve transparency of domestic gas pricing to better understand its disparity with Qatar’s export prices. Liquefication and export facilities could be expanded alongside the North Field LNG expansion to allow export of extra domestic gas supply to generate additional revenue and support Qatar’s climate initiatives to ensure efficient natural gas use domestically. Gradually aligning domestic natural gas prices with export ones would also incentivize the private sector to build comparative advantages beyond low energy cost, fostering diversification that is not reliant on the hydrocarbon sector. 17.

Qatar’s fiscal multipliers over the last three decades are estimated to be stronger than those in other GCC countries, especially for capital expenditure. However, multipliers have fallen as the investment cycle from the World Cup matured, suggesting more limited returns from future public infrastructure investment (Box I). Meanwhile, investment to build a knowledge-based economy, including to leverage Qatar’s advanced digital access and readiness to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) (see Section D), and enhance climate resilience and sustainability, could generate high returns, not only in terms of direct growth gains, but also in creating an enabling environment for the private sector.9  Any public sector-driven initiatives to promote private sector development should avoid supporting unviable firms.

(2011) and Fouejieu et al (2018) with both a GCC panel estimate (and teasing out Qatar-specific effects) and a single-country time-series analysis for Qatar. Generally, Qatar had stronger fiscal multipliers than its GCC peers, but the gains from capital expenditure weakened when capital stock became relatively high. Results from cross-GCC panel regression suggest that for the GCC, the average long-run fiscal multiplier for capital expenditure (0.7) is stronger and more persistent than that for current expenditure (statistically insignificant), although the growth gains from the former emerge with a lag. The Qatar-specific long-term cumulative multiplier for capital expenditure (based on the GCC panel regression and a country dummy for Qatar) is close to 1.5. When capital stock is relatively high, however, the capital spending multipliers for both Qatar and the GCC become insignificant. A further analysis confirms how growth gains from capital spending in Qatar waned when the infrastructure investment cycle appeared to have matured (Box Figure 1-1). Using a single-county approach, time-varying fiscal multipliers from capital spending in Qatar are estimated on a 12-year rolling basis. Results suggest that World Cup-related capital spending in the 2010s had stronger (first panel) and more persistent (second panel) growth impact than previous public investment. These may reflect a more comprehensive infrastructure investment strategy and/or higher spending efficiency.2 However, as the infrastructure investment cycle started to mature, the growth effects moderated. 9 Annex VII.

The banking sector remains healthy despite the growth normalization and tighter financial conditions, thanks to robust buffers, diligent QCB policies and ample hydrocarbon liquidity.

The QCB should make more granular data (e.g., the average maturity structure of banking sector foreign assets and liabilities, NPLs by sector) available to enhance monitoring and facilitate risk assessment.

C. Monetary Policy: Further Enhance Effectiveness of the Operational Framework 25. The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The peg remains a credible monetary anchor, backed by ample external buffers, continued fiscal prudence and competitiveness- enhancing reforms. In line with the exchange rate peg, Qatar’s monetary policy is broadly aligned with that of the U.S. Federal Reserve. More recently, the QCB cut policy interest rates three times, each time 5 basis points more than the US Federal Reserve did, narrowing the interest rate differential with the US fed funds rate (Figure 2). Going forward, staff recommended that the QCB continue to adjust its policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve. The QCB’s enhanced liquidity management is welcome and could benefit from stronger coordination with the fiscal authority.",

As recommended by a recent IMF TA, the QCB should improve analytical capacity for liquidity forecasting and country risk premium assessment as the first step towards more effective liquidity management and monetary policy implementation. Finalizing the upgrade to a new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system towards a more integrated wholesale payment system will reduce risks and enhance efficiency in the central bank’s secured lending operations. Over time, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor, developing a more active interbank market, and allowing banks to base their lending rates fully on market conditions by removing the cap on salary-based personal loans would further enhance monetary policy transmission. Greater central bank communication would also be important to support these efforts. Text Figure 14.

They emphasized the ongoing effort to build capacity and planned to progressively implement TA recommendations. The QCB noted that the recent policy interest rate cuts, slightly more than the US Federal Reserve’s, were motivated by a relatively wide interest rate differential to the Fed funds rate, domestic macroeconomic conditions (growth normalization and low inflation), and excess liquidity in the financial system. They highlighted that the recent policy moves did not have any negative effects including on capital flows, and future policy decisions would be data driven. The QCB acknowledged the need to further improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework but saw it as a medium-term objective. They agreed on the importance of communication and highlighted continued efforts to enhance it. D. Structural Reforms: Build a Knowledge-Based and Sustainable Economy 28. Qatar’s vision to build a diversified, knowledge-based economy requires enhanced human capital and output complexity (Text Figures 15 and 16). Staff analysis shows that human capital is not only a large, direct contributor to per-capita output, but also an amplifier of the growth-enhancing impact of higher economic complexity. 12 Physical capital has similar, albeit smaller, effects. When a country has high levels of human and physical capital, the amplification effect (with economic complexity) on output is even stronger. Qatar has built a large capital stock with top- notch infrastructure quality, but its labor productivity and economic complexity have substantial room to improve. Reforms should thus focus on: (i) building a highly skilled labor force, (ii) promoting innovation and knowledge-spillovers (including through FDI and trade diversification) to boost economic complexity,",

Qatar can build a future-ready labor force by: • Attracting and retaining high-skilled expatriate workers. Qatar currently has more semi- skilled expatriate workers than skilled or highly skilled ones (Text Figure 17). Analysis in the IMF’s 2023 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar suggests that increasing the share of more skilled expatriate workers can be a top contributor to growth. Intensified Kafala reform would further enhance expatriate labor market protection and flexibility. Speedy implementation of newly introduced programs targeting higher-skilled expatriate labor (e.g., new visa schemes including a five-year Mustaqel residence visa for foreign talent and entrepreneurs and a visa extension program for graduating students to find jobs in Qatar) would improve labor force skills. Strengthening the social safety net including the pension scheme would also help. The renewed 4-year collaboration program with ILO can support the authorities’ progress. • Enhancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector. Qatar’s education investment is bearing fruit—more outcome-based education spending could help close the gap with OECD countries (Text Figure 17). Efforts should also strengthen to incentivize Qatari nationals to join the private sector, especially the new graduates.

Successful implementation of Qatar’s ambitious reform agenda hinges on proper prioritization, inter-agency coordination, effective execution, and careful management of policy spillovers. Many reform initiatives are in train to achieve NDS3 goals. They should be properly sequenced to prioritize more impactful reforms and explore synergies and complementarities. Inter-agency coordination is critical to ensure policy consistency and maximize implementation capacity. Incentives to various specialized economic zones and centers to promote FDI and trade, as well as policy support to “diversification clusters,” should target well-identified externalities, market and coordination failures, or under-provision of public input—they are no substitution for broad-based structural reforms. Diversification gains from economic zones and priority sectors should be broadened to the wider economy by promoting stronger spillovers. Periodic cost-benefit assessments will help rationalize incentives and keep them time-bound. 32. Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI (Text Figure 20). Qatar’s digital infrastructure, quality and affordability are comparable to those in advanced economies (AEs). The Digital Agenda 2030, launched in March 2024, sets further ambitions in enhancing digital innovation, expanding e-government services, developing digital skills, and refining regulatory frameworks. Qatar is also close to AEs in its AI readiness, and its labor market has a relatively large share of jobs that can benefit from AI rather than being replaced, making the country well- positioned to reap AI-driven productivity gains with limited job displacement risks (Box II). Enhancing digital skills of the labor force, promoting digital/AI penetration in production, strengthening cybersecurity risk management and facilitating job transitions are critical to fully benefit from digitalization and AI while mitigating labor market risks. 33.",

AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact1 Qatar has been actively preparing for embracing AI. In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy, focusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee, established in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion AI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is close to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart). Increasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market. Currently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade), comparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff analysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high “complementarity”—workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than being replaced.

The authorities agreed with staff recommendation to focus reforms on boosting human capital and innovation, enhancing the business environment, attracting FDI and promoting exports. They agreed that Qatar was well placed to leverage AI for productivity gains, and highlighted Qatar’s comparative advantage in energy cost and reliability to attract data centers, around which an ecosystem could be built to enhance domestic value added. Box 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded) The private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar’s labor market toward a more favorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the last decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and complementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to benefit from AI adoption. “Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching the occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with the AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure and complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the “growth clusters” identified in NDS3— manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—tend to have more limited AI exposure.

    "content": "accelerating reform efforts, Qatar can further solidify its resilience to shocks and prosperity. 38. The authorities’ commitment to sustain fiscal discipline can be supported by accelerated fiscal reforms. Adopting a PIH-based medium-term fiscal anchor can help ensure intergenerational equity and guide a countercyclical fiscal policy. Accelerating revenue diversification including to introduce the VAT would enhance revenue resilience and reduce the tax revenue gap. To support efficient NDS3 reform implementation and ensure fiscal sustainability, it is important to enhance spending efficiency through rationalizing the wage bill and gradually phasing out the remaining subsidies, and improve spending composition to facilitate the transition to private sector-led growth. Gradually aligning domestic energy prices with export ones could generate additional revenue and support Qatar’s climate goals. The ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged MTFF with enhanced fiscal risk management.",

Maintaining diligent supervision is important especially for banks with weaker asset qualities. Formalizing the financial safety net would further enhance financial stability. The QCB should continue to review its macroprudential policies and adjust as needed to mitigate potential macro-financial risks. Guided by FSS3, efforts to develop domestic capital market should accelerate, which would also help banks reduce their reliance on public sector deposits and exposure to short- term foreign funding. Qatar’s excellent efforts in fighting financial crimes should continue. 40. The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The QCB should continue to adjust its policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve while improving its liquidity forecasting. Over time, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor, promoting a more active interbank market, and allowing fully market-based bank lending interest rates would enhance monetary policy transmission. Qatar’s external position in 2023 was assessed to be moderately stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. 41. Qatar’s vision to build a more diversified and knowledge-based economy calls for enhancing human capital and boosting economic complexity. Attracting and retaining high- skilled expatriate workers, enhancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector, and further benefiting from the female talent will enhance human capital. Economic complexity can be boosted by fostering innovation, promoting trade diversification, attracting FDI with domestic knowledge spillovers, and further improving business efficiency. Successful implementation of Qatar’s ambitious reform agenda hinges on proper prioritization, inter-agency coordination,",

Overview of Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy This Annex provides a brief overview of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which sets the priorities to build a knowledge-based and more sustainable economy. It stresses the state’s role as an enabler of private sector-led growth, based on a candid assessment of the limitations and challenges associated with a state-driven growth model. 1. Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) aims for a transformation toward a private sector-led, knowledge-based, and more sustainable economy (Annex Figure 1-1). Issued in January 2024, NDS3 covers the last miles of Qatar’s National Vision (QNV) 2030. From NDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar’s diversification strategy has gradually transitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the private sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage Qatar’s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human capital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic transformation, with ambitious targets set. 2. NDS3 highlights Qatar’s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision 2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and institutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008–23 (average 5½ percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10 percentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar’s education and health systems, labor market including for expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements. 3. NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar’s diversification journey. Qatar’s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC",

NDS3 acknowledges relatively low non- hydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification model driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and incentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and highly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains less skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an immature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further transformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic diversification. 4. NDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and sustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close remaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the need to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through additional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to facilitate private sector participation. It also identifies “diversification clusters” to build comparative advantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.",

A more sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework is envisaged, supported by diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 targets include to reach a fiscal surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (the past five-year-average was 3 percent), maintain the current sovereign credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and achieve manageable expenditure growth (below the non-hydrocarbon output growth rate). The government plans to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, and enhance debt management through frameworks including sovereign green financing. • Human capital. The government will promote STEM education and upskill the Qataris. Initiatives to attract high-skilled expatriate workers will include labor immigration reforms, upskilling programs with private sector participation, and new visa schemes for elite talent and entrepreneurs. The goal is for skilled labor force to exceed 46 percent of the total by 2030 (currently at 28 percent), with 20 percent of the Qatari workforce in the private sector (currently at 17 percent). • Inclusiveness. Qatar aims at maintaining a high fertility rate (of 3 percent) and increase the economic participation of people with disabilities (to 30 percent by 2030). The government will launch marriage and family support programs, enhance maternity leave, and promote financial literacy. For vulnerable segments, initiatives include better identification, skill development, and expanded social services. Women's empowerment and volunteerism (targeting a 10 percent volunteer rate) will also be key focuses. • Health.

External Sector Assessment Overall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained robust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In 2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical levels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to progressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in the pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current account gap is expected to continue narrowing. Potential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged under NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. Fiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and spending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the external position in the medium term. Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory Background1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and large asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities side, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but rose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central bank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023. Assessment. On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are",

Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export volume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance outflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus remained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and imports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong.

Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model that yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests a negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts (0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate further in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. Real Exchange Rate Background. The Riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at 3.64 since July 2001. Qatar’s nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciated by 1 percent, similar to the US’s. Qatar’s real effective exchange rate (REER) weakened by 1 percent in 2023 as the nation’s inflation was below its trading partners’. In 2024 through November, REER depreciated somewhat from the same period in 2023. Assessment. With large reliance on hydrocarbon exports priced in U.S. dollars and elastic supply of expatriate labor, the impact of REER performance on Qatar’s competitiveness is limited. Based on the estimated CA gap of 2.0 and an elasticity of 0.3, staff assesses REER as undervalued by 5.6 percent. The EBA-lite REER model suggests an overvaluation of 13.6 percent.

The strong foreign asset position, including the QIA’s estimated sizable assets, limits risks and vulnerabilities related to capital flows. Declines in commercial banks’ foreign liabilities have reduced financial stability risks. FX Intervention and Reserves Level Background. The large current account surplus only translated into a moderate increase in central bank foreign reserves in 2023, by US$4 billion to reach US$51.5 billion, equivalent to 24 percent of GDP, 7.8 months of prospective imports, 196 percent of short-term external debt, and an estimated 59 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric (ARA, up from 52 percent in 2022)2. Much of the current account surplus was estimated to have been invested by the QIA overseas. In 2024H1, foreign reserve accumulation ($1 billion) remained more modest than implied by the size of the current account surplus (US$20 billion). Assessment. Qatar’s “overall” FX reserve coverage was adequate in 2023. QCB foreign reserves are complemented by large foreign assets held by the QIA, estimated at 220 percent of GDP in 2023. Together, they account for about 600 percent of the ARA metric, significantly above the 100 percent adequacy benchmark. _____________________________________________________________________________ 1The authorities face capacity constraints to provide comprehensive IIP data. 2The ARA is a composite metric that measures the adequacy of precautionary reserves. It is based on the relative risk weights for each source of foreign exchange drain drawing on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from emerging market economies during exchange market pressure episodes.

Nowcasting of Non-hydrocarbon GDP Growth in Qatar This Annex applies nowcasting, which has been widely used for near-term growth projections, to Qatar’s real non-hydrocarbon output growth, with several innovations. Results fit historical data well and point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. A few caveats related to the machine-learning approach for nowcasting are also discussed. 1. Nowcasting generates real-time forecasts for key economic indicators where the official data may be unavailable or delayed by analyzing high-frequency macroeconomic indicators. For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy makers and businesses may need a more timely assessment of the economy to inform policy and business decisions—nowcasting is an effective tool to fill the gap. This technique is particularly suitable where high-frequency indicators are abundant and published timely, as in the case of Qatar. Nowcasting models are also highly adaptable—they can be updated regularly with new data, ensuring that the estimates remain relevant and accurate amidst changing economic conditions. 2. A nowcasting model for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on previous IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps below: • Select predictive variables. A wide range of economic and financial indicators are selected to capture domestic, regional and global conditions that could affect Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy. These variables are chosen based on criteria such as predictive power (i.e., suggested by the pairwise correlation between the predictive variable and Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP), data availability, and minimal lag time. A balance is maintained between the number of predictors and the size of the training data (used to fit nowcasting models with historical trends)",

A few innovations have been introduced to Qatar’s nowcasting framework to optimize the variable and model selections: • A big data approach in variable selection is developed to enhance the coverage of potential predictors of economic growth and reduces the lag between real-world events and nowcasts. Unlike traditional methods that select variables based on specific economic theories, this approach collects a large number of variables including those that are unconventional in economic analysis, and evaluates their correlations with Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Specifically, a Stata program is developed to scrape the Haver and CEIC databases, identifying relevant keywords in millions of data series. The keywords target data specific to Qatar and its key trading partners. The program chooses 1,300 Qatar-specific series and 1,200 series related to Qatar’s trading partners for further selection. For the 2,500 variables, pairwise correlations are run against Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Those with the highest correlations (both positive and negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari economy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to 13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley decomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative variables and iterate with alternative variables. • Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets. Unlike traditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better",

Qatar’s nowcasting results, which fit historical data well, point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth normalization. Various nowcasting models are compared based on their out-of-sample forecast performances (Figure 4). The Support Vector Machine (RBF) model, with the lowest RMSE, proves to be the most effective one for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP growth prediction. An average RMSE of 1.4 across the best models indicates Qatar’s nowcasting framework performs comparably to those for regional peers (see Korniyenko et al, 2023). Figure 5 shows the overall fit of the model up to 2023Q4 and the nowcasting results up to 2024Q3, which point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. Table 1 provides a list of variables used in the final Qatar model. Nine of the variables are Qatar-specific, covering the real sector (e.g., inflation and oil activities), external sector (e.g., export oil price to China), and financial sector (e.g., 3-month deposit rate and credit facilities). The remaining 4 series capture economic activities in Qatar’s key trading partners. Figure III. 4. Qatar: Model Selection (Out of sample performance) Source: IMF staff calculations.",

Near term 1/ Low Low Near-term risks are assessed as low consistent with the mechanical signal. Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high, and commitment to, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support a strong fiscal position and the projected reduction in the debt ratio. Medium term Low Low Medium-term risks are assessed as low consistent with the mechanical signal. Continued fiscal discipline is assumed, the debt level is expected to decline further, and the QIA holds substantial financial assets. Fanchart Low … GFN Low … Stress test ... … Long term … Low Long-term risks are low supported by the QIA’s large financial assets, manageable aging-related and social security expenditures, and strong natural gas reserves. As the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas will likely play a key role for a smoother energy transition relative to fossil fuels with higher emission. Qatar's production cost is low. These together support sizeable revenues over a long term.

Note: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt restructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing. 1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement.

    "content": "Statement by Mohamed Maait, Executive Director for Qatar, and Mira Merhi, Advisor to Executive Director January 27, 2025 On behalf of the Qatari authorities, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to the Staff mission team for the constructive discussions during the recent Article IV consultation. Economic Developments and Outlook Underpinned by its long-term strategic diversification plan “the Qatar National Vision 2030”, the Qatar economic transformation is thriving, and substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and institutional development. After a very strong economic performance in 2022, boosted by the successful hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, output growth has normalized in 2023 and 2024, with recent signs of economic activities strengthening at the end of 2024, notably in the tourism sector. Qatar's inflation has been generally declining throughout 2023 and 2024. The medium-term outlook is positive, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and by reform efforts which are expected to intensify under the upcoming Third National Development Strategy as well as under the Third Financial Sector Strategy (3FSS) which is also expected to provide impetus for a sustainable growth.  Qatar’s strong fundamentals and significant policy buffers would help mitigate any negative impact in case downside risks materialize. Fiscal Policy The State of Qatar’s low public debt, significant fiscal and external buffers, and the longer-term benefits and returns of the authorities’ investment plans for future generation are remarkable. The authorities continue to be fully committed to a prudent fiscal policy that aim to optimize the use of Qatar’s resources by improving spending efficiency and mobilizing non-oil revenues, all whilst promoting sustainable growth and preserving intergenerational equity. The 2024 budget was focused on allocating resources for the third National Development",

The general budget continues to focus on achieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 related to the development of human capital by focusing on the health and education sectors – with the allocations for the two sectors constituting 20% of the total budget - in addition to the goals related to diversifying the local economy and enhancing its competitiveness. The authorities are committed to a sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework supported by diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 targets include to reach a fiscal surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (way above the past five-year-average of 3 percent), maintain the current sovereign credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and achieve manageable expenditure growth. The government plans to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, and enhance debt management through frameworks including sovereign green financing. The authorities intend to continue addressing underlying spending inefficiencies and diversify fiscal revenues notably through implementing the corporate income tax Pillar II in line with the global timeline. The 2025 budget envisages broadly prudent spending plans and aims for a medium-term expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have made good progress in expanding program-based budgeting to eventually cover all sectors by the end of 2025 and expect that the ongoing expenditure review would generate savings in the medium term. Moreover, the authorities plan to enhance their macroeconomic projections to support the medium-term budget update. The authorities view the fiscal risks from ongoing PPPs, mainly on operating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be minimal.",

    "content": "Monetary and Financial Sector Policies The Central Bank of Qatar (QCB) continues to skillfully manage monetary and financial policies, preserving macroeconomic and financial stability and promoting sustainable growth. The authorities agree with staff’s assessment that the exchange rate peg continues to serve the Qatari economy well. They appreciated the IMF technical Assistance on liquidity management and plan to progressively implement its recommendations. The QCB aims to further improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework as a medium-term objective. Qatar’s banking sector is healthy, with strong capital buffers, sound liquidity and stable profitability. Furthermore, QCB maintains a robust regulatory framework and conducts effective supervision to ensure the health of the sector and to preempt any potential risks to financial stability. The QCB is committed to regular risk reassessment and the newly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened the assessment of emerging risks and early action. Banks are well prepared to manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were effectively implemented to address potential risks. The micro and macroprudential measures, including the counter- cyclical capital buffer, are periodically reviewed, and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. Moving forward, developments in Qatar’s financial sector will be further supported by the Third Financial Sector Strategy (3FSS) covering the period 2023-2030. The strategy will be focusing on governance and regulatory oversight; Islamic finance; digital innovation and advanced technologies; ESG and sustainability; and talent and capabilities, with the aim to create vibrant financial and capital markets that lead the region in innovation, efficiency, and investor protection. “Based on a four-pillar approach - banking, insurance, digital finance, and capital markets",

    "content": "- the Strategy provides a roadmap for the financial sector in Qatar to unlock its full potential in line with Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030. Qatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, as acknowledged by the 2023 AML/CFT mutual evaluation report by FATF which highlighted the strength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement through improved risk assessment capacity and clearer policy priorities. The QCB has also banned financial institutions to use crypto assets. The authorities remain firmly committed to strengthening the AML/CFT framework in alignment with global standards, with a focus on risk-based supervision and effective enforcement to uphold financial integrity and resilience. Structural Reforms The Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024-2030 marks the final phase of the Qatar National Vision 2030. Since launching the National Vision in 2008, Qatar has made significant strides by leveraging energy sector revenues to build world-class infrastructure and institutions. As a result, Qatar’s nonhydrocarbon economy has grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output, which underscores Qatar’s commitment to long-term economic diversification. The NDS3, launched in January 2024, aims to achieve sustainable economic growth, establish a sustainable medium-term general budget framework with healthy levels of debt, provide a high standard of living to Qataris and position Qatar as a global destination. The strategy also aims at boosting human capital and innovation, enhancing the business environment, attracting FDI and promoting exports. The establishment of the National Planning Council will have a significant role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring inter-agency coordination, and monitoring progress. The authorities have recently launched the Qatar National Manufacturing Strategy for 2024-2030 aiming to drive sustainable economic development, diversify key economic sectors, boost private sector participation and",

The recent launch of the National Health Strategy 2024-2030 will also further reinforce the goals of NDS3. The authorities are on track to meet their 2030 climate targets. Furthermore, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change has launched its 2024 – 2030 Strategy aiming to support environmental sustainability, enhance Qatar’s ability to adapt to climate change, protect the environment and conserve its natural resources. The strategy will advance sustainable environmental practices while supporting research, innovation, and digital transformation, and strengthening the environmental legislation and policies. Reflecting Qatar’s national targets and its commitment to environmental sustainability, the strategy includes a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, the restoration of 30% of affected natural habitats, the protection of 30% of land and coastal areas and the conservation of 17 endangered and endemic species to preserve biodiversity. The authorities recognize that reliable and timely economic data are essential for effective policymaking and reform implementation. To this end, they are actively working to strengthen data quality and coverage to facilitate well- informed decision-making. Conclusion Through prudent policies, sound fiscal and monetary management, and ambitious reforms, the State of Qatar has well-positioned itself to achieve its long-term economic National Vision 2030 and to further strengthen its prominent position within the global economy.",

    "content": "| Overall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately |  |  |  |  |  | \n | stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained |  |  |  |  |  | \n | robust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In |  |  |  |  |  | \n | 2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical |  |  |  |  |  | \n | levels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to |  |  |  |  |  | \n | progressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in |  |  |  |  |  | \n | the pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current |  |  |  |  |  | \n | account gap is expected to continue narrowing. |  |  |  |  |  | \n | Potential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged |  |  |  |  |  | \n | under NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. |  |  |  |  |  | \n | Fiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and |  |  |  |  |  | \n | spending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the |  |  |  |  |  | \n | external position in the medium term. |  |  |  |  |  | \n | Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory |  |  |  |  |  | \nBackground1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and\nlarge asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities\nside, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but\nrose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central\nbank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.\nAssessment. On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are\nestimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the\nprojected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of\nexternal public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt\nSustainability Assessment). Commercial banks’ external liability remained broadly unchanged, leaving the\nnet foreign liability relatively large. |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n2023 (% GDP) |  | NIIP: NA | Gross Assets:\nNA | QCB Res. Assets: 24.2 | Gross Liab.: NA | Debt Liab.: 123 | \n | Current Account |  |  |  |  |  | \nBackground. The current account surplus fell from a decade high in 2022, by nearly 10 percentage points of\nGDP to 17 percent of GDP in 2023. Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export\nvolume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance\noutflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus\nremained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and\nimports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is\nthus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of\nGDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high,\nalbeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices. |  |  |  |  |  |  |",

    "content": "Assessment. Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by\nfundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model\nthat yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests\na negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s\nsignificant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment\nmethodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume\nvolatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts\n(0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate\nfurther in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied\nby fundamentals and desirable policies.\nCurrent Account Balace and Oil Prices Qatar: EBA-lite Model Results, 2023 1/\n30 120 CA model REER model\n(in percent of GDP)\n20 CA-Actual 17.1\n90\nCyclical contributions (from model) (-) 0.9\n10 Natural disasters and conflicts (-) -1.1\nAdjusted CA 17.3\n60\n0 CA Norm (from model) 15.4\nCA Gap 2.0 -4.7\n-10 CA (% of GDP) 30 o/w Relative policy gap 2.0\nOil prices (right, US$ per barrel) Elasticity -0.3\n-20 0 REER Gap (in percent) -5.6 13.6\n18 20 22 24 26 28 30 1/ Based on the EBA-lite 3.0 methodology. |  | \n | Real Exchange Rate | \nBackground.

The capital and financial account weakened in 2023. The composition shifted notably.

In contrast, net other investment outflows declined by\n16 percentage points to 1 percent of GDP. Overseas investment declined and net reduction in liabilities\nmostly by commercial banks following the introduction of QCB measures, moderated.

It is based on the relative risk weights\nfor each source of foreign exchange drain drawing on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from emerging market\neconomies during exchange market pressure episodes. Reserves in the range of 100–150 percent of the composite metric\nare considered broadly adequate for precautionary purposes. |  |",

The shock could translate into higher global\nhydrocarbon prices, but there is also the risk of LNG\nexport disruption—the overall impact on Qatar is\nhighly uncertain. Intensification of regional\nconflict(s) could also weaken investor confidence\nand disrupt supply chain, tourism, and capital flows. |  |  | The policy response would depend on the\nnature of the shock.

Continue to\nclosely monitor financial institutions.\n | High |  |  | High |  | \nCommodity price volatility. Supply and\ndemand fluctuations (e.g., due to conflicts,\nexport restrictions, OPEC+ decisions, and\ngreen transition) cause recurrent\ncommodity price volatility, external and\nfiscal pressures and food insecurity in\nEMDEs, cross-border spillovers, and social\nand economic instability. |  |  | Qatar’s ongoing LNG production expansion will\nraise the economy’s sensitivity to energy price\nvolatility. Higher-than-projected energy prices could\nstrengthen fiscal and external positions, and non-\nhydrocarbon output growth as ample hydrocarbon\nliquidity and positive private sector confidence\ncould boost consumption and investment. Pressures\nto increase public spending could rise. Lower oil\nprices would weaken the external and fiscal\nbalances, and growth. |  |  | The authorities should implement a medium-\nterm fiscal framework which helps insulate\npublic spending from oil price volatility.\nDiversifying the revenue base toward more\nnon-hydrocarbon sources would reduce\nrevenue sensitivity to energy price volatility.\nAccelerate structural reforms to advance\neconomic diversification.\n | Medium |  |  | Medium |  | \nGlobal growth downside surprise. Growth\nslowdown in major economies, including\ndue to supply disruptions, tight monetary\npolicy, rising corporate bankruptcies, or a\ndeeper-than-envisaged real estate sector\ncontraction, with adverse spillovers through\ntrade and financial channels, triggering\nsudden stops in some EMDEs. (Low\nprobability is assigned to surprise\nacceleration in global growth). |  |  | Lower external demand reduces hydrocarbon export\nprices, weakening fiscal and external positions which\nare currently strong. Slower global growth would\nalso weigh on domestic growth, affecting banking\nsector asset quality. Global financial market\ncorrections may lead to capital outflows and\nincrease financial stability risks, including due to\nbanks’ still sizeable exposure to foreign funding. |  |  | Qatar has fiscal space to respond to a major\ngrowth slowdown. Fiscal policy should be\nanchored in a medium-term framework to\nreduce the risk of procyclicality. Continue to\nclosely monitor banking sector developments\nto maintain financial stability. Accelerate\nstructural reforms to boost economic\ndiversification and non-hydrocarbon\npotential output.\n | Medium |  |  | Low |  | \nMonetary policy calibration.

On the other hand, a monetary stance too\ntight for too long than warranted could negatively\naffect demand, but the ongoing public investment\nand spillovers from the North Field LNG expansion\nwill support growth. |  |  | Maintain monetary policy and liquidity\nmanagement that are consistent with the\ncurrency peg.

Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved.\nNational accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by\nexpenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter,\nthe quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were\nreleased in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).\nPrices. Monthly Consumer and Producer Price Indices (CPI, PPI), and real estate price data are published timely. CPI weights need to be updated more frequently. The\nMinistry of Justice publishes Weekly Newsletter with daily property transaction data by type which can benefit from greater consistency to better inform surveillance.\nGovernment finance. The authorities are implementing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which enables compilation of accrual fiscal\naccounts. An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the\npublication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports\ncould include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line\nitems, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister\nprovided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release. The coverage of financial\noperations should be broadened to the general government including the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).\nExternal sector. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reports quarterly balance of payments data timely, following the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual (BPM5).\nThe financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Stock Exchange.\nHowever, financial account data are aggregated. The authorities need to improve coordination to enhance the coverage of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow data (which\ndeviate significantly from FDI commitment data). A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly\nInternational Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data\nto the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar's participation in key\nsurveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).\nMonetary and financial sectors. The QCB submits the monetary and financial statistics (MFS) for the central bank and other depository corporations based on the\nStandardized Report Forms (SRFs). The MFS data are published in the International Financial Statistics on a timely basis. Qatar also reports data on some key series and\nindicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile money and the two indicators of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, but does not report data by\ngender. The QCB reports the Financial Soundness Indicators as part of the National Summary Data Page, but does not submit to the IMF, and 4 indicators are missing\nrelative to the IMF’s list of Core Financial Soundness indicators.\nChanges since the last Article IV consultation. The Planning and Statics Authority was replaced by a newly established National Planning Council to strengthen reform\nimplementation stipulated in the Third National Development Strategy, including to improve statistics. The statistics authority is in the process of producing new supply\nand use tables to improve the consistency of GDP estimates. A household survey is being finalized, which will be used to update CPI weights. The domestic “FDI ecosystem”\nhas been fully mapped to identify additional sources of input data including business registration platforms (i.e., QFC, QSTP, QFZA, Media city) which will increase survey\nframe from current 130+ entities to 2000+ entities.\nCorrective actions and capacity development priorities. Enhance awareness across government entities of the data gaps and international best practices. Implement\nrecommendations made by the above-mentioned TAs. Encourage the authorities to seek the Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) training, additional Statistics\nDepartments (STA) TAs, and participate in the workshop on the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to be organized by the newly established Riyadh Regional\nOffice. Urge the National Planning Council and National Statistics Center to coordinate efforts across relevant government entities on statistics including consolidation of\nscattered data, submission to the IMF, and broader publication.\nUse of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. IIP data are unavailable, including QIA’s assets under management. Staff\nrely on different data sources as needed––it estimates external debt data (for non-bank private sector and public sector debt outside of the central government), uses\nalternative data sources for FDI, and relies on commercially available bank-level data.\nOther data gaps. A more granular forward-looking calendar of key data releases would aid surveillance and enhance transparency. By maturity assets and liabilities data\nand by sector non-performing loans (NPLs) data will enhance the assessment of banking sector risks for surveillance. Data on enterprises, particularly small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs), and on climate change adaptation and mitigation would help inform surveillance.",
